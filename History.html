          miHoYo was founded in 2012 by three Chinese Shanghai Jiaotong
          University graduate students who shared a passion for technology and
          ACG (anime, comics, and games) culture., who decided to develop games
          based on their love of anime. A year prior, the students had developed
          FlyMe2TheMoon. The founders of miHoYo, Cai Haoyu, Liu Wei, and Luo
          Yuhao are classmates of Shanghai Jiaotong University. In February
          2012, three students who were still students and another classmate Jin
          Zhicheng jointly funded the establishment of miHoYo. But one month
          after the company was founded, Jin Zhicheng quit the company because
          he got an offer from Cisco China. After several years of development,
          in the first half of 2017, miHoYo achieved a net profit of 440 million
          RMB.[1] Currently, the controlling shareholder and actual controller
          identified by miHoYo is Cai Haoyu, who directly or indirectly controls
          41.72% of the company's shares. The other two founders, Liu Wei and
          Luo Yuhao, are the company's second and third largest shareholders,
          respectively, and they directly or indirectly control 44.78% of the
          company's shares. All three are company directors.[5] Their first
          notable title was Guns Girl Z (then renamed to Houkai Gakuen 2),
          released in 2014.[6] Since then, they have seen success releasing
          anime-style games that primarily appealed to mobile gamers. The
          majority of their early titles were successful within Asia, however
          they would not reach global success until the release of Honkai Impact
          3rd.[7] miHoYo has since gone on to become the original IP creator and
          interactive entertainment company that it is today. To date miHoYo's
          products include Zombiegal Kawaii, Guns GirlZ, Honkai Impact 3rd,
          Genshin Impact, and more high-quality creations that are loved and
          adored by their fan base. In the future, miHoYo will continue to
          create more original products with a sincere dedication to
          transformation and technological innovation, continuing to pave its
          own path in the industry. Company Milestones
